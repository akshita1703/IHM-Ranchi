    <section class="exam-rules">
      <h2>Examination Rules</h2>
      <div class="exam-content">
          <p>Examinations are a method to evaluate the level of understanding, grasping, and observing subjects, products, and adopting ethics of the chosen field.</p>
  
          <h3>The process of examinations is divided into two components:</h3>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Internal Examinations</strong>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Written tests</li>
                      <li>Practical tests</li>
                      <li>Course-wise assignments</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Term-End Examinations (NCHMCT Examination)</strong>
                  <p>
                      At the end of each academic semester, eligible students are required to appear for the term-end examination, which includes both theory and practical examinations. Theory and practical examinations conducted at the end of each semester will carry weightage in the final result.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      As per NCHMCT norms, a minimum of 40% marks are required in each theory subject to pass, and a minimum of 50% marks are required in each practical exam.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      For further clarification, students and guardians are requested to check the NCHMCT Exam Guide available on the websites of IHM Ranchi and NCHMCT.
                  </p>
              </li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3>Eligibility for Admission to the Examination:</h3>
          <p>
              To be eligible for the Council’s examinations (any semester/term or course), a candidate must meet the following criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Have been on the roll of an affiliated institution for one full academic session (period of study) in the course for which they wish to take the examination.</li>
              <li>Submit their application to the Controller of Examinations through the head of the institution last attended or another authority nominated by the National Council for Hotel Management and Catering Technology.</li>
              <li>Produce a certificate signed by the forwarding authority, confirming they attended not less than 75% of the aggregate lectures, practicals, and tutorials held during the session (effective teaching hours/contact hours).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Attendance shall be counted from the date of session commencement as per the Council's calendar.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> A student is expected to attend 100% of all classes (theory, practical, and tutorials). The above relaxation is provided for absence due to unforeseen reasons.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every period of lecture, tutorial, practical, project, or workshop shall be counted as one unit for attendance purposes. For example, if a class covers four periods at a time, four units of attendance will be counted.</li>
    <li>Each candidate must complete laboratory work, practical assignments, and project work to the satisfaction of the Head of the Institution. The Head must certify the candidate's progress, conduct, and character as fit for appearing in the examination. Candidates debarred by any statutory examination authority or government are not eligible.</li>
    <li>Students engaged in extracurricular or co-curricular activities (e.g., Food Exhibitions, Chef Competitions, Education tours) with the Principal's permission shall be treated as present per the timetable. The institute will maintain attendance records for such activities.</li>
    <li>If a candidate's attendance falls short by up to 10% due to bonafide illness (supported by a medical certificate) or other reasons deemed sufficient by the Head of the Institution (e.g., a death in the family), the Head can condone such shortfalls and allow the candidate to appear in the examination, if eligible.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Industrial Training is not part of the above and will be treated separately.</p>

<h3>Industrial Training (IIIrd or IVth Semester of B.Sc. in Hospitality & Hotel Administration):</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Industrial Training requires an input of 102 days (17 weeks × 6 days/week = 102 days).</li>
    <li>A minimum of 87 days of Industrial Training is mandatory for eligibility to appear in the examination. Students may avail 15 days of leave with prior hotel authority approval.</li>
    <li>Students failing to complete 87 days of Industrial Training will not be permitted to take the examination and will be considered as failing the subject. They may complete the shortfall during vacations and appear in the subsequent examination if otherwise eligible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Rules:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A candidate disallowed from appearing in an examination due to attendance shortfalls must fulfill all conditions afresh before becoming eligible.</li>
    <li>Students detained in the same semester/term (due to attendance shortfalls or other reasons) must repeat the semester/term as a regular student in the following year. They will not progress to the next semester until eligible.</li>
    <li>Attendance for provisionally promoted students to the next class will be counted from the session start date.</li>
    <li>A candidate passing an examination cannot reappear for the same examination. Improvement in passed subjects is not permitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Candidates meeting the eligibility conditions but opting not to appear for the examination may appear in a subsequent examination as external students. Their internal assessments will be preserved by the Head of the Institution for the next exam.</p>
<h3>Application for Admission to Examination</h3>
<p>All applications for admission to the examination shall be accompanied by the necessary fee prescribed by the National Council for Hotel Management and forwarded through the Head of the Institution on or before the last date notified by the National Council every year. An additional late fee as prescribed shall be charged for each late application received in the National Council’s office not later than 15 days after the notified last date and up to 30 days before the commencement of examination.</p>
<p>The Controller of Examination, National Council for Hotel Management & Catering Technology, shall, however, be competent to accept such late applications without any late fees even after the notified date in case he is satisfied that the application was in fact submitted by the candidate to the Institution in time but could not reach the National Council’s office before the notified date on account of failure of authorities in the Institution to do so.</p>
<p>The Head of the Institution shall be competent to withdraw such applications in respect of those candidates who do not fulfill any of the laid-down conditions at any time before the commencement of the examination. All detained students must be communicated to the National Council before the commencement of examinations.</p>

    <li>Making false statements in forms will lead to a one-year disqualification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Disqualification for one academic year means failing all subjects of the examination and not being eligible for the next term-end examination. Re-entry to the system requires fulfilling all eligibility conditions or appearing as an external candidate after the disqualification period.</p>

<h3>Minimum Pass Marks</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To pass a theory subject, a candidate must secure at least 40% marks (Internal Assessment + End Term Examination).</li>
    <li>To pass a practical subject, Industrial Training, Research Project, or Term Work, a candidate must secure at least 50% marks (Internal Assessment + End Term Examination).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For mark computation, a fraction of half or more is rounded up to the next whole number.</p>

<h3>Internal Assessment</h3>
<p>The internal assessment reflects the candidate's performance in in-course assessments held at the institute. It constitutes 30% of the marks allotted to the subject in the final result computation by the Council. Details of in-course assessments for each semester are outlined in the examination scheme.</p>
